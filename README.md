# flask
A first flask application featuring 2 features:

1. A tracker for the International Space Station which gives the current location and pasover points for the user. The user location is obtained through IP geolocation so will not be accurate if the user is accessing with a VPN.

2.  As the application was made during COVID lockdown, the second function plots the daily rates of COVID based on an existing dataset. There are varying ways to view the data.
